{comment: Strophe 1}
[D]Light of the [A]world
You stepped [Em]down into darkness
[D]Opened [A]my eyes, [G]let me see
[D]Beauty that [A]made [Em]this heart adore you
[D]Hope of a [A]life spent [G]with you
{comment: Refrain}
So [G]here I am [D]to worship
Here I am [A]to bow down
Here I am [D]to say that You're my [G]God
And you're altogether [D]lovely altogether [A]worthy
Altogether [S]wonderful to [G]me
{comment: Strophe 2}
[D]King of all [A]days, oh [Em]so highly exalted
[D]Glorious in [A]heaven [G]above
[D]Humbly [A]You came to the [Em]earth You created,
[D]All for love's [A]sake became [G]poor
{comment: Bridge}
[A]I'll never [D]know how [G]much it cost
to [A]see my [D]sin [G]upon that cross [2x]
