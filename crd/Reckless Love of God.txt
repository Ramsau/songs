{comment: Strophe 1}
[Em]Before I spoke a [D]word,
 You were singing [C]over me.
[Em]You have been so, [D]so good to [C]me.
[Em]Before I took a [D]breath, 
You breathed Your [C]life in me.
[Em]You have been [D]so, so kind to [C]me.
{comment: Refrain}
Oh the [Em]overwhelming, [D]never-ending,
[C]reckless love of [G]God
Oh, it [Em]chases me down, [D]fights 'till I'm found,
[C]leaves the ninety-[G]nine.
I couldn't [Em]earn it, I don't [D]deserve it.
Still, you [C]give yourself [G]away.
Oh, the [Em]overwhelming, [D]never-ending, 
[C]reckless love of god!
{comment: Strophe 2}
[Em]When I was Your [D]foe, still Your love [C]fought for me.
[Em]You have been [D]so, so good to [C]me.
[Em]When I felt no [D]worth, You paid it [C]all for me.
[Em]You have been [D]so, so kind to [C]me.
{comment: Bridge}
[Em]There's no shadow You won't [D]light up, 
mountain You won't [C]climb up, coming after [G]me.
[Em]There's no wall You won't [D]kick down,
lie You won't tear [C]down, coming after me [x2]
