{comment: Strophe 1}
[C]Come thou fount of every [G/B]blessing.
Tune my [F]heart to [G]sing Thy [C]grace.
Streams of [C]mercy, never [G/B]ceasing,
Call [F]for songs of [G]loudest [C]praise.
[G/B]Teach me [Am]some melodious [F]sonnet,
Sung by [Am]flaming tongues [F]above.
Praise the [C]mount, I'm fixed [G/B]upon it,
Mount of [F]Thy red[G]eeming [C]love.

{comment: Strophe 2}
[C]Here I raise my [G/B]Ebenezer,
Hither [F]by Thy [G]help I'm [C]come.
And I [C]hope by thy good [G/B]pleasure,
Safely [F]to [G]arrive at [C]home.
[G/B]Jesus [Am]sought me when a [F]stranger,
Wandering [Am]from the fold of [F]God.
He, to [C]rescue me from [G/B]danger,
Inter[F]posed [G]His precious [C]blood.

{comment: Strophe 3}
[C]Oh to grace, how great a [G/B]debtor,
Daily [F]I'm con[G]strained to [C]be!
Let thy [C]goodness, like a [G/B]fetter,
Bind [F]my wandering [G]heart to [C]Thee.
[G/B]Prone to [Am]wander, Lord I [F]feel it,
Prone to [Am]leave the God [F]I love.
Here's my [C]heart, oh take and [G/B]seal it.
Seal it [F]for Thy [G]courts [C]above.
