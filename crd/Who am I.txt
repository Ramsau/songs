{comment: Verse 1}
Who am [C]I that the [G/B]Lord of all the [Am7]earth
Would [G]care to know my [F2]name would [G/F]care to feel my [F]hurt
Who am [C]I that the [G/B]Bright and Morning [Am7]Star
Would [G]choose to light the [F2]way for my [G/F]ever wand'ring [F]heart       [C/E]

{comment: Pre-Chorus}
Not be - [F]cause of who I [Gsus]am but be - [Am7]cause of what You've [G/B]done
Not be - [Am7]cause of what I've [G/B]done but be - [F]cause of who You [G]are     [F/G]

{comment: Chorus}
[C] I am a [G/B]flower quickly [Am7]fading here to - [G]day and gone to - [F]morrow
A [G]wave tossed in the [F]ocean a vapor [G]in the wind
[C] Still You [G/B]hear me when I'm [Am7]calling Lord You [G]catch me when I'm [F]falling
And You've [G]told me who I [F]am
I am [C]Yours

{comment: Verse 2}
Who am [C]I that the [G/B]eyes that see my [Am7]sin
Would [G]look on me with [F2]love and [G/F]watch me rise a - [F]gain
Who am [C]I that the [G/B]voice that calmed the [Am7]sea
Would [G]call out through the [F2]rain and [G/F]calm the storm in [F]me        [C/E]
