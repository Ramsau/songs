{comment: Verse 1}
How great the [C]chasm that lay be - [Gsus]tween us
How high the [F2]mountain  [Am7] I could not [Gsus]climb
In desper - [C]ation I turned to [Gsus]heaven
And spoke Your [F2]name in - [Gsus]to the [C]night
Then through the [F2]darkness Your loving-[C]kindness
Tore through the [Am7]shadows of my [G(4)]soul
The work is [C]finished the end is [Gsus]written
Jesus [F]Christ, my [Gsus]living    [C]hope      [F2]

{comment: Verse 2}
Who could im - [C]agine so great a [Gsus]mercy?
What heart could [F2]fathom  [Am7] such boundless [Gsus]grace?
The God of [C]ages stepped down from [Gsus]glory
To wear my [F]sin and [Gsus]bear my [C]shame
The cross has [F2]spoken, I am for - [C]given
The King of [Am7]kings calls me His [G(4)]own
Beautiful [C]Savior, I’m Yours for - [Gsus]ever
Jesus [F]Christ, my [Gsus]living    [C]hope

{comment: Chorus}
Halle - [F2]lujah,   [C] praise the [G]One who set me [Am7]free!
Halle - [F2]lu -  [C]jah, death has [G]lost its grip on [Am7]me!
You have [F2]broken every [C]chain, there’s sal - [G]vation in Your [Am7]name
[C/G]Jesus    [F2]Christ, my [Gsus]liv -  [G]ing   [Am]hope    [C/E]

{comment: Verse 3}
Then came the [C]morning that sealed the [Gsus]promise
Your buried [F2]body   [Am7] began to [Gsus]breathe
Out of the [C]silence, the Roaring [Gsus]Lion
Declared the [F2]grave has no [Gsus]claim on [Am]me    [C/E]
Jesus, [F2]Yours is the [C/G]vic -  [G]to - [C]ry!
