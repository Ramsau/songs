{comment: Strophe 1}
[Bm]You call me out [A/C#]upon the wa[D]ters
The great [A]unknown where feet may [G]fail
[Bm]And there I find you [A/C#]in the [D]mystery
In oceans [A]deep My faith [G]will stand
{comment: Refrain}
[G]And I will [D]call upon Your [A]name
[G]And keep my [D]eyes above the [A]waves
When oceans [G]rise
My soul will [D]rest in your [A]embrace
For I am [G]Yours and [A]You are [Bm]mine [G D A]
{comment: Strophe 2}
[Bm]Your grace abounds in [A/C#]deepest [D]waters
Your sovereign [A]hand Will be my [G]guide
[Bm]Where feet may fail and [A/C#]fear sur[D]rounds me
You've never [A]failed and you won't start now
{comment: Bridge}
[G]Spirit lead me where my [D]trust is without borders
let me [A]walk upon the waters
Wherever [Em]You would call me
[G]Take me deeper than my [D]feet could ever wander
And my [A]faith will be made stronger 
In the [Em]presence of my Saviour [2x]
