What gift of [C]grace is Jesus, my Re[F]deemer
There is no [C]more for heaven [Am]now to [G]give
He is my [C]joy, my righteousness, and [F]freedom
My steadfast [C]love, my [Gsus]deep and [G]boundless [Csus]peace [C]
To this I [F]hold: my hope is only [C]Jesus
[C/E]For my [F]life is [C]wholly bound to [Gsus]his
Oh how [C]strange and di[Dm7]vine, I can [C/E]sing: all is [F]mine!
Yet not [C/G]I but through [Gsus]Christ [G]in [C]me

{comment: Verse 2}
The night is [C]dark, but I am not for[F]saken
For my my [C]side the Saviour, [Am]he will [G]stay
I labour [C]on in weakness and re[F]joicing
For in my [C]need his [Gsus]power [G]is dis[Csus]played [C]
To this I [F]hold: my Shepherd will de[C]fend me
[C/E]Through the [F]deepest [C]valley he will [Gsus]lead [G]
Oh the [C]night has been [Dm7]won and I [C/E]shall over[F]come!
Yet not [C/G]I but through [Gsus]Christ [G]in [C]me

{comment: Verse 3}
No fate I [C]dread, I know I am for[F]given
The future [C]sure, the price, it [Am]has been [G]paid
For Jesus [C]bled and suffered for my [F]pardon
And he was [C]raised to [Gsus]over[G]throw the [Csus]grave [C]
To this I [F]hold: my sin has been de[C]feated
[C/E]Jesus [F]now and [C]ever is my [Gsus]plea [G]
Oh the [C]chains are re[Dm7]leased, I can [C/E]sing: I am [F]free!
Yet not [C/G]I but through [Gsus]Christ [G]in [C]me

{comment: Verse 4}
With every [C]breath I long to follow [F]Jesus
For he has [C]said that he will bring me [G]home
And day by [C]day I know he will re[F]new me
Until I [C]stand with [Gsus]joy be[G]fore the [Csus]throne [C]
To this I [F]hold: my hope is only [C]Jesus
[C/E]All the [F]glory [C]evermore to [Gsus]him
When the [C]race is com[Dm7]plete, still my [C/E]lips shall re[F]peat:
Yet not [C/G]I but through [Gsus]Christ [G]in [C]me
