{comment: Verse 1}
O Lord my [G]God,        when I in [C]awesome wonder 
Consider   [G/D]all  the [D]worlds Thy hands have [G]made      [D]
I see the [G]stars,        I hear the [C]rolling thunder
Thy pow'r through - [G/D]out  the [D]universe dis - [G]played     [D]

{comment: Chorus}
Then sings my [G]soul,      my    [C]Saviour God, to [G]Thee 
How great Thou [Am7]art,       [D]  how great Thou [G]art         [D]
Then sings my [G]soul,      my    [C]Saviour God, to [G]Thee 
How great Thou [Am7]art,       [D]  how great Thou [G]art

{comment: Verse 2}
When through the [G]woods        and forest [C]glades I wander
And hear the [G/D]birds    sing [D]sweetly in the [G]trees      [D]
When I look [G]down        from lofty [C]mountain grandeur
And hear the [G/D]brook    and [D]feel the gentle [G]breeze    [D]

{comment: Verse 3}
And when I [G]think        that God His [C]Son not sparing
Sent Him to [G/D]die,  I   [D]scarce can take it [G]in         [D]
That on the [G]cross,        my burden [C]gladly bearing
He bled and [G/D]died   to  [D]take away my   [G]sin         [D]

{comment: Verse 4}
When Christ shall [G]come        with shout of [C]acclamation
And take me    [G/D]home–    what [D]joy shall fill my [G]heart     [D]
Then shall I [G]bow         in humble [C]adoration
And there pro - [G/D]claim,   my [D]God, how great Thou [G]art         [D]
