{comment: Strophe 1}
[G]You hear me when I call
You are my morning song
[C]Though darkness fills the night
It cannot hide the light
[Em]Whom shall I [C]fear
{comment: Refrain}
[Em]I know who [D]goes be[G]fore me
[Em]I know who [D]stands be[G]hind
[Em]The God of [C]angel armies
Is always [D]by my [G]side
[Em]The one who [D]reigns for[G]ever
[Em]He is a [D]friend of [G]mine
[Em]The God of [C]angel armies
Is always [D]by my [G]side
{comment: Strophe 2}
[G]You crush the enemy
Underneath my feet
[C]You are my sword and shield
Though troubles linger still
[Em]Whom shall I [C]fear
