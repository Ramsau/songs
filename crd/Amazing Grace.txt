Capo 4

{comment: Strophe 1}
[G]Amazing grace how [C]sweet the [G]sound
That saved a wretch [D]like me
I [G]once was lost, but [C]now I'm [G]found
Was [Em]blind but [D]now I [G]see
{comment: Strophe 2}
[G]'Twas grace that taught
my [C]heart to [G]fear,
And grace my fears [D]relieved;
[G]How precious did that [C]grace [G]appear,
[Em]The hour [D]I first be[G]lieved!
{comment: Strophe 3}
[G]The Lord has promised [C]good to [G]me,
His word my hope [D]secures;
[G]He will my shield and [C]por[G]tion be,
[Em]As long as [D]life en[G]dures.
