Capo 4

{comment: Strophe 1}
[G]Amazing grace how [C]sweet the [G]sound
That saved a wretch [D]like me
I [G]once was lost, but [C]now I'm [G]found
Was [Em]blind but [D]now I [G]see
{comment: Strophe 2}
[G]'Twas grace that taught
my [C]heart to [G]fear,
And grace my fears [D]relieved;
[G]How precious did that [C]grace [G]appear,
[Em]The hour [D]I first be[G]lieved!
{comment: Chorus}
My [G]chains are [C]gone I've been set [G]free
My God my [C]Savior has ransomed [G]me
And [G]like a [C]flood His mercy [G]rains
Unending [Am]love [D]amazing [G]grace
{comment: Strophe 3}
[G]The Lord has promised [C]good to [G]me,
His word my hope [D]secures;
[G]He will my shield and [C]por[G]tion be,
[Em]As long as [D]life en[G]dures.
{comment: Strophe 4}
[G]The earth shall soon dis[C]solve like [G]snow
The sun forbear to [D]shine
[G]But God who called me [C]here be[G]low
[Em]Will be [D]forever [G]mine
[Em]Will be [D]forever [G]mine
[Em]You are [D]forever [G]mine
