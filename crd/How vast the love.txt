Come [C]gaze upon your Savior, be  - [Am7]hold your [G]great High [F]Priest
Draw [C]near in awe and wonder, His [Am7]cross has [G]spoken [F]peace

Come [C]rest from sin and striving, find [Am7]endless [G]stores of [F]grace
The [C]heart that turns to Jesus is [Am7]cleansed from [G]ev'ry [Gsus]stain

{comment: Chorus}
[G]Oh, how [F]deep, how wide, how long [C]
Oh, how [Am7]vast the love of Je[G]sus
Oh, how [F]sure, how sweet, how strong [C]
Oh, how [Am7]vast His love for [G] us    [G]

So [C]lift your eyes to Jesus, a - [Am7]rise from [G]doubt and [F]shame
His [C]blood cries "It is finished!" Our [Am7]life is in His [Gsus]Name

What [C]now can separate us?   Can [F2(no3)]death or pain or fear?
We [C]have this strong assurance, in [F2(no3)]Christ we've been brought near

And [C]in His [Dm]strength we'll [F]labor, His [Am]promis - [G]es our [F]hope
Thus [C]far His [Dm]love has [F]led us! His [Am7]love will [F]lead us [G]home!
