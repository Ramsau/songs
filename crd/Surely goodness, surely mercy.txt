The [F]Lord is my [G]shepherd, I shall [Csus]not   [C]want

Surely [F]goodness, surely [Csus]mer - [C]cy
Right be - [F]side me all my [C]days

[F]You prepare a [G]table right be - [Csus]fore   [C]me
[F]In the presence [G]of my ene - [C]mies

I will fear no [Csus]e  -  [C]vil    [Csus]    [C]
(And) [C/E]even though I [F]walk through the valley of the [F]shadow of death
You are on my [C]side        [Csus]oh    [C]
