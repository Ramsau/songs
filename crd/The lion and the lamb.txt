{comment: Verse 1}
He's [B]coming on the clouds, kings and kingdoms [C#m]will bow [E]down
And [G#m]every chain will break as broken hearts de - [F#]clare His [E]praise
For who can stop the [F#]Lord Almighty?

{comment: Chorus}
[B]    Our God is the Lion, the [F#]Lion of [G#m7]Judah
He's roaring with [G#m7]power, and [F#]fighting our [E]battles
And every knee will [F#]bow before Him
[B]  Our God is the Lamb, the [F#]Lamb that was [G#m7]slain
For the sins of the [G#m7]world, His [F#]blood breaks the [E]chains
And every knee will [F#]bow before the Lion and the [E]Lamb
Every knee will [F#]bow before Him

So [B]open up the gates, make way before the [C#m]King of [E]kings
