D4. Der Löwe und das Lamm
Capo 4

{comment: Verse 1}
He's [G]coming on the clouds, kings and kingdoms [Am7]will bow [C]down
And [Em]every chain will break as [Dsus]broken hearts declare His [C]praise
For who can stop the [Dsus]Lord Almighty?

{comment: Chorus}
[G]Our God is the Lion, the [Dsus]Lion of [Em7]Judah
He's roaring with power, and [Dsus]fighting our [C]battles
And every knee will [Dsus]bow before Him
[G]Our God is the Lamb, the [Dsus]Lamb that was [Em7]slain
For the sins of the world, His [Dsus]blood breaks the [C]chains
And every knee will [Dsus]bow before the Lion and the [C]Lamb
Every knee will [Dsus]bow before Him

{comment: Verse 2}
So [G]open up the gates, make way before the [Am7]King of [C]kings
The [Em]God who comes to save is here to set the [Dsus]captives [C]free
For who can stop the [Dsus]Lord Almighty?

{comment: Bridge}
[Am7]Who can stop the [G/B]Lord Almighty?
[C]Who can stop the [Dsus]Lord Almighty?
[Am7]Who can stop the [G/B]Lord Almighty?
[C]Who can stop the [Dsus]Lord?
