{comment: Verse 1}
I once was [A]lost in darkest [Bm]night yet thought I [G]knew the [Bm]way
The sin that [Em]promised joy and [G]life had led me [A]to the [D]grave
I had no [D/F#]hope that You would [G]own a rebel [Em]to Your [Bm]will
And if You [D/F#]had not loved me [G]first I would re - [Bm]fuse You [A]still

{comment: Verse 2}
But as I [A]ran my hell - bound [Bm]race indifferent [G]to the [Bm]cost
You looked up - [Em]on my helpless [G]state and led me [A]to the [D]cross
And I be - [D/F#]held God’s love dis - [G]played You suffered [Em]in my [Bm]place
You bore the [D/F#]wrath reserved for [G]me now all I [Bm]know is [Asus]grace        [A]

{comment: Chorus}
[D]Halle - [G]lu   -   [D]jah all I [A]have is [Bm]Christ
Halle - [G]lu   -   [Bm]jah Jesus [A]is my [D]life

{comment: Verse 3}
Now Lord I [A]would be Yours a - [Bm]lone and live so [G]all might [D]see
The strength to [Em]follow Your com - [G]mands could never [A]come from [D]me
O Father [D/F#]use my ransomed [G]life in any [Em]way You [Bm]choose
And let my [D/F#]song forever [G]be my only [Bm]boast is [Asus]You        [A]
