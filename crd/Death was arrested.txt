{comment: Verse 1}
A - [A]lone in my sorrow and [D]dead in my [A]sin
[F#m]Lost without hope with no [Esus]place to be - [A]gin
Your [A]love made a way to let [D]mercy come [A]in
When [F#m7]death was arrested and [Esus]my life be - [A]gan

{comment: Verse 2}
[A]Ash was redeemed only [D]beauty re - [A]mains
[F#m]My orphan heart was [Esus]given a [A]name
My [A]mourning grew quiet my [D]feet rose to [A]dance
When [F#m7]death was arrested and [Esus]my life be - [A]gan

{comment: Chorus}
Oh Your [D]grace so [A]free washes [F#m7]over    [E]me
You have [D]made me new now [F#m7]life begins with [E]You
It's Your [D]endless [A]love pouring [F#m7]down on [E]us
You have [D]made us new now [F#m7]life begins with [E]You            [(D)]  (To Verse 4)

{comment: Verse 3}
Re - [A]leased from my chains I'm a [D]prisoner no [A]more
My [F#m7]shame was a ransom He [Esus]faithfully [D2(no3)]bore
He [A]cancelled my debt and He [D]called me His [A] friend
When [F#m7]death was arrested and [Esus]my life be - [A]gan

{comment: Verse 4}
Our [A]Savior displayed on a [Bm7]criminal's cross
[D2(no3)]Darkness rejoiced as though [E]Heaven had [F#m7]lost
But then [A]Jesus arose with our [D]freedom in [A]hand
That's when [F#m7]death was arrested and [E]my life be - [A]gan

{comment: Bridge}
Oh we're [A]free free for - [D]ever we're [A]free
[F#m7]Come join the song of [E]all the re - [A]deemed
Yes we're [A]free free for - [D]ever a - [A]men
When [F#m7]death was arrested and [E]my life be - [A]gan
When [F#m7]death was arrested and [E]my life be - [A]gan
When [A/D]death was arrested and [E]my life be - [A]gan
