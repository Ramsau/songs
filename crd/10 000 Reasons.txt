Bless the [G]Lord, o my [D]Soul,
[A]O my [Bm]soul,
[G]Worship His ho[D]ly [A]name.
Sing like [G]never be[Bm]fore,
[G]O [A]my [Bm]soul.
I'll [G]worship your [A]holy [G]name [D] [G] [D]
{comment: Strophe 1}
The [G]sun comes [D]up, it's a [A]new day [Bm]dawning;
[G]It's time to [D]sing Your [A]song [Bm]again.
[G]Whatever may [D]pass,
and what[A]ever lies be[Bm]fore me,
[G]Let me be [D]singing when
the [A]evening [D]comes. [G] [D]
{comment: Strophe 2}
You’re [G]rich in [D]love and You’re [A]slow to [Bm]anger
Your [G]name is [D]great and Your [A]heart is [Bm]kind
For [G]all Your [D]goodness I will [A]keep on [Bm]singing
[G]Ten thousand [D]reasons for my heart   [A]to    [D]find [G/D] [D]
{comment: Strophe 3}
And [G]on that [D]day when my [A]strength is [Bm]failing,
The [G]end draws [D]near, and my [A]time has [Bm]come;
[G]still my [D]soul will sing Your [A]praise un[Bm]ending:
[G]Ten thousand [D]years and then [A]forever[D]more! [G/D] [D]
