{comment: Strophe 1}
[C]Tired of endless [G]walking
Not knowing which [Am]way to go
I collapsed on a streed [F]called mercy
I was found [C]in You
{comment: Strophe 2}
Throwing Your [G]arms around me
You held me like [Am]I was Yours
Like You'd been there the [F]whole time waiting
I was found in [C][G][Am][F]You
{comment: Refrain}
You are [G]all I want
You are [Am]all I need
Every breath I [F]take is a breath to say
I am Yours now forever (2x)
{comment: Strophe 3}
[C]Wrapped up in [G]scarlet kindness
You welcomed [Am]this sinner home
Now I breathe in the [F]air of heaven
All I [Dm]want [F][C]is You
{comment: Strophe 4}
Keep me within [G]Your shadow
Lord, tether my [Am]heart to Yours
I want nothing without [F]Your presence
All I want [Dm][C]is You
