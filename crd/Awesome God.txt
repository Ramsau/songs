{comment: Strophe 1}
[Em]When he rolls up his sleeve he ain't puttin' on the ritz
Our [Am]God is an [D]awe[Em]some God
There is thunder in his footsteps and lightning in his fists
Our [Am]God is an [D]awe[Em]some God
The [C]Lord wasn't joking when He kicked 'em out of [Em]Eden
It [D]wasn't for no reason that he [G]shed [D]His [Em]blood
His re[C]turn is very soon so you better be [Em]believin'
That our [Am]God is an [D]awe[Em]some God
{comment: Refrain}
[Em]Our [C]God is an awe[G]some God
He [D]reigns from [Em]heaven [D]a[Em]bove
With [C]wisdom, [G]power and love
Our [Am]God is an awe[D]some [Em]God!
{comment: Strophe 2}
And [Em]when the sky was starless in the void of the night
Our [Am] God is an [D]awe[Em]some God
He spoke into the darkness and created the light
Our [Am] God is an [D]awe[Em]some God
[C]Judgement and wrath he poured out on Sodom
[D]Mercy and grace He [G]gave us [D]at the [Em]cross
I [C]hope that we have not too quickly forgotten
That our [Am]God is an awe[D]some [Em]God!
