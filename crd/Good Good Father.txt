Capo 3

{comment: Strophe 1}
[G]I've heard a thousand [G]stories
of what they think You're like
[G]But I've heard the tender [G]whisper
of love in the dead of night
And You [C2]tell me [G/B]that You're pleased
and [Am7][D]that I'm never alone
{comment: Refrain}
You're a good, [C2]good father
It's who You [G/B]are, it's who you [Am7]are,
it's who [D]You are
And I'm [C2]loved by you
It's who I [G/B]am, it's who I [Am7]am, it's who I [D]am
{comment: Strophe 2}
[G]I've seen many [G]searching for answers far and wide
[G]But I know we're all [G]searching
for answers only you provide
[C2]Because You [G/B]know
just what [Am7]we need before we say a word
{comment: Bridge}
[C2]You are perfect in all [Em]of your ways
[Am7]You are perfect in all [G]of your ways
[C2]You are perfect in all [Em]of your [D]ways to us
{comment: Strophe 3}
[G]Love so undeniable [G]I can hardly speak
[G]Peace so [G]unexplainable I can hardly think
As You [C2]call me [G/B]deeper still
As You [Am7]call me [G/B]deeper still
As You [C2]call me [G/B]deeper still
Into [Am7]love love [D]love
