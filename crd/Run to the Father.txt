{comment: Verse 1}
[C]  I've carried a [Dm7]burden        [Am7]  for too long on my [F2] own
[C]  I wasn't cre - [Dm7]ated        [Am7]    to bear it a - [F2]lone
[C] I hear Your invi - [Dm7]tation        [Am7]    to let it all [F2]go
I see it [C]now I'm laying it [Dm7]down and I know that [Am7]I    [G]need    [F2]You

{comment: Chorus 1}
I run to the [C]Father I fall into [Dm7]grace
I'm done with the [Am7]hiding no reason to [F2]wait
My heart needs a [C]surgeon my soul needs a [Dm7]friend
So I'll run to the [Am7]Father again and a - [F2]gain
And again and a - [C]gain

{comment: Interlude 1}
[C]    Oh    [Dm7]    oh    [Am7]    oh    [F2]

{comment: Verse 2}
[C]  You saw my con - [Dm7]dition        [Am7]  had a plan from the [F2] start
[C]  Your Son for re - [Dm7]demption        [Am7]    the price for my [F2]heart
[C]  I don't have a [Dm7]context        [Am7]    for that kind of [F2]love
I don't under - [C]stand I can't compre - [Dm7]hend all I know is [Am7]I    [G]need    [F2]You

{comment: Interlude 2}
[C]    Oh    [Dm7]    oh    [Am7]  again and a - [F2]gain
And again and a - [C]gain    oh    [Dm7]    oh    [Am7]    oh    [F2]
Again and a - [C]gain

{comment: Bridge}
My heart has been [Am7]in Your [F2]sights long before [C/E]my first [G]breath
Running in - [Am7]to Your [F2]arms is running to [C/E]life from [G]death
I feel this [Am7]rush deep in my [F2]chest Your mercy is [C/E]calling    [G]out
Just as I [Am7]am You pull me [F2]in and I know I [C/E]need You [G]now

{comment: Chorus 2}
I run to the [C]Father I fall into [Dm7]grace
I'm done with the [Am7]hiding no reason to [F2]wait
My heart found a [C]surgeon my soul found a [Dm7]friend
So I'll run to the [Am7]Father again and a - [F2]gain
And again and a - [C]gain
